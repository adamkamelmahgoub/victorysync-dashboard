# 🚀 BUG FIX READY - READ THIS FIRST!

## 📋 WHAT HAPPENED

Your app shows **"No organization is linked to your account"** error even though:
- User IS logged in ✅
- User IS in the database ✅  
- User HAS organization membership ✅
- But something is blocking the dashboard ❌

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE FOUND

**The bug is in Supabase RLS (Row-Level Security) policies**

The app stores org membership in: `org_users` table  
But Supabase RLS checks: `org_members` table (WRONG!)

User exists in `org_users` but not in `org_members`  
→ RLS denies access → "No organization is linked" error
