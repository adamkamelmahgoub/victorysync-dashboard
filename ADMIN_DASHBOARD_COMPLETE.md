- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states and success notifications

### Data Flows
```
Admin Dashboard
    ├── Overview Tab → GET /api/admin/orgs + GET /api/admin/users
    ├── Organizations → GET /api/admin/orgs
    ├── Users Tab → GET /api/admin/users + POST /api/admin/users
    ├── Members & Invites → GET /api/orgs/:orgId/members + POST /api/orgs/:orgId/members + DELETE
    └── Settings → (Ready for backend integration)
```
